# Welcome to the Liri App

## What is the Liri App?
A Siri-like application that returns information based on user input.

## How does it work?
Simply enter in one of the following commands and Liri will return information for you:
* "my-tweets" -- will return 20 of the latest tweets of a pre-set user
* "movie-this" + [movie_title] -- will return various information about the movie specified
* "spotify-this-song" + [song_title] -- will return various information about the song specified
* "do-what-it-says" -- Liri will read the accompanying text file and perform any command specified within.

## What was the goal of the Liri App?
The goal of this project was to create a Siri like clone that performs some basic functionalities. Combining Javascript with APIs, I was able to flex my newfound Node skills.
